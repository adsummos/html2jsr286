Known bugs:
  * HTMLparser cannot handle inline JavaScript that contains arbitrary HTML tags

  * Rails flash messages are passed one redirection when using the GET method, but not with POST

There are a few gotchas:

  * XHR actions are not filtered; if they produce new HTML, it is not parsed

  * sessions do not work outside a particular portlet, even if shared by the same controller.
    You can use sessions for simple tasks, such as flash messages and storing temporary values,
    but as soon as the page is reloaded, the session vanishes. This means it is possible to share
    sessions between actions and controllers when using XHR requests, though!
